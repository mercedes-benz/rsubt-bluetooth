/**
 * Represents new local device Bluetooth adapter. The {@link BluetoothAdapterExt}
 * lets you perform fundamental Bluetooth tasks, such as initiate
 * device discovery, query a list of bonded (paired) devices,
 * instantiate a {@link BluetoothDevice} using a known MAC address, and create
 * a {@link BluetoothServerSocket} to listen for connection requests from other
 * devices, and start a scan for Bluetooth LE devices.
 *
 * <p>To get a {@link BluetoothAdapterExt} representing the local Bluetooth
 * adapter, call the {@link BluetoothManager#getAdapter} function on {@link BluetoothManager}.
 * On JELLY_BEAN_MR1 and below you will need to use the static {@link #getDefaultAdapter}
 * method instead.
 * </p><p>
 * Fundamentally, this is your starting point for all
 * Bluetooth actions. Once you have the local adapter, you can get a set of
 * {@link BluetoothDevice} objects representing all paired devices with
 * {@link #getBondedDevices()}; start device discovery with
 * {@link #startDiscovery()}; or create a {@link BluetoothServerSocket} to
 * listen for incoming RFComm connection requests with {@link
 * #listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord(String, UUID)}; listen for incoming L2CAP Connection-oriented
 * Channels (CoC) connection requests with {@link #listenUsingL2capChannel()}; or start a scan for
 * Bluetooth LE devices with {@link #startLeScan(LeScanCallback callback)}.
